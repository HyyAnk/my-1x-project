# GitHub publishing checklist

The project is ready to be placed in a Git repository.

## Included

- TypeScript source, shared schemas, templates, rules, tests, documentation, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- `channels/` as the local production source of truth. Git tracks only `.gitkeep`; channel and episode content stays on the local machine.
- `.documentary-studio/storage.local.json` as a local-only pointer to the selected content folder.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, typechecks, tests, and builds.
- `.gitattributes` with normalized text line endings.

## Excluded

- `node_modules/`, build output, coverage, Playwright artifacts, local logs, task records, the cached Codex executable, and all local channel/episode artifacts.
- `.env` files except a future `.env.example`.
- Private key and certificate file extensions.

## Before publishing publicly

1. Confirm that local channel content is intentionally excluded by `.gitignore`.
2. Decide on and add a license.
3. Configure the GitHub remote and push from the local repository.
4. Never commit API keys, Codex credentials, private keys, or personal logs.
