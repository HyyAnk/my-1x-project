# AI Documentary Studio

Local-first workspace for managing channel DNA, documentary topics, scripts, and scene plans with Codex.

## Start locally

Requirements:

- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 11 or newer
- Codex installed and authenticated if AI generation is needed

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:2233`. The browser talks to the local Fastify server on port `4310`; credentials and filesystem access stay on the server.

For the complete one-click startup, use [`run dashboard.bat`](run%20dashboard.bat). It prepares the local Chatterbox environment on first run, starts the sidecar, waits for the model to be ready, and only then opens the dashboard. `pnpm dev` is intended for frontend/backend development and does not perform the heavy Python setup.

On Windows, double-click [`run dashboard.bat`](run%20dashboard.bat). It checks Node.js, Python, Corepack, pnpm, and workspace packages, starts the local services, and opens the dashboard.

When finished, use the Power button in the dashboard top bar or [`stop dashboard.bat`](stop%20dashboard.bat) to stop the local services. Channel and episode files remain in the selected local storage folder.

Production build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Run checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Publish to GitHub

The repository is prepared for GitHub. Runtime logs, task records, Playwright output, build folders, local environment files, the cached Codex binary, and local channel artifacts are ignored. Channel content remains on the local machine as the production source of truth; `channels/.gitkeep` only preserves the empty folder in Git.

From the project root:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial AI Documentary Studio workspace"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<your-repository>.git
git push -u origin main
```

This repository includes the MIT license in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Review it before redistributing the project.

## Repository layout

The selected storage folder is the local production source of truth. Inside its `channels/` directory, each channel contains `channel.json`, `channel_dna.md`, `style_guide.md`, topic history, and episode folders. Episode artifacts are readable Markdown files plus `episode.json`. These generated and authored content files are intentionally not pushed to GitHub.

`.documentary-studio/` contains project configuration, a local-only storage pointer, task records, Codex metadata, and structured logs. The selected storage folder contains the actual channel and episode files; it never replaces those content files as the source of truth.

The Codex settings panel supports local Codex App Server and Cockpit's OpenAI-compatible API Service. The API key is stored only in the ignored `.documentary-studio/codex.local.json` file.

## Current scope

The first release covers:

- channel creation, editing, archive, delete, and DNA editing;
- exactly-five lightweight topic candidates and confirmation into an episode;
- script generation/editing;
- scene breakdown with paired dialogue and video prompts;
- manual scene edits, copy actions, backups, and single-scene regeneration;
- per-scene and batch Chatterbox audio generation with inline playback, reusable voice library, optional voice reference, duration mismatch warning, and stale-audio invalidation;
- separate ZIP or merged WAV episode export with configurable silence between scenes;
- task queueing, per-channel/per-episode locks, progress events, approvals, and reconnect states.
- automatic cleanup of completed Codex sessions, configurable failed-session retention, and manual cleanup from Settings.

Video generation remains a provider interface for now. Audio generation is implemented locally through the Chatterbox sidecar, which `run dashboard.bat` prepares and starts automatically.

## Notes

The Codex App Server adapter uses the documented JSONL stdio transport by default. On Windows, if the Store-installed executable cannot be launched directly, the server automatically caches a runnable copy under `.documentary-studio/codex/`. Set `codex.command`, `codex.app_server_endpoint`, or `codex.model` in `.documentary-studio/config.json` when the local installation needs an explicit command or endpoint. See [Codex integration](docs/codex-integration.md) for the lifecycle and context contract.
